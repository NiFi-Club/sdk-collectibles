Collectible NFTs SDK
Created by Nifi Club

## Getting started

To start with Collectible NFTs SDK, you will need to create .env file. (You have example file - .env.sample)

PORT - application port
PINATA_APIKEY - api key for pinata client
PINATA_SECRET - secret key for pinata client 
MONGODB_URL_SDK - url to mongodb database, where all the information will be saved
SWIFT_HASH_SDK - swift hash without : symbol
SWIFT_UPDATE_INTERVAL_MS_SDK - swift update interval, default is 1000 ms
COL_ROOT_ADDR - collection root address
PINATA_GATEWAY - pinata gateway, use this one https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/

MSIG_PUBLIC - multisig public key (for mint transaction)
MSIG_SECRET - multisig secret key (for mint transaction)
MSIG_ADDRESS - multisig address (for mint transaction)

TON_ENDPOINTS - 
   for dev: 'https://net5.ton.dev/|https://net1.ton.dev/',
   for main net: 'https://main2.ton.dev/|https://main3.ton.dev/|https://main4.ton.dev/'


Then you will need to create mongodb class for swift codes, and it must be named as SWIFT_CODES, here is an example of data:


SKD needs this 3 objects to start: 
{
"code": "SRC-CT",
"description": "Collectible series creation", // description for action, can be changed
"applicableContractType": ["nifi.col1"],
"actionCapture": "Mint fee received" // message for action, can be changed
}

{
"code": "SRC-PY",
"description": "Receipt of mint payment", // description for action, can be changed
"applicableContractType": ["nifi.col1"],
"actionCapture": "Mint fee received" // message for action, can be changed
}

{
"code": "TK-MT",
"description": "Token mint", // description for action, can be changed
"applicableContractType": ["nifi.col1"],
"actionCapture": "Token minted" // message for action, can be changed
}

## Queries from frontend

To create collectible, you will: 

1. Save images to ipfs, needs to make a query to https://yourdomain/sdk/images/upload with payload like this:
{
   image: binary
}
   
2. Send request to https://yourdomain/sdk/series/generate with such payload: 

{
   "name": "Best EVER collectible",
   "description": "My first EVER collectible",
   "layers": [
      {
         "layer": "Background",
         "images": [
            {
               "subtitle": "Pink background",
               "hash": "QmXpZoozntT7Af7MHPs62trvimx6E9VtT6n4Wt7D861iP8",
               "mimetype": "image/png",
               "width": 2000,
               "height": 2000,
               "weight": 19185,
               "rarity": 4
            }
         ]
      }
   "creatorFees": 500,
   "mintCost": 1170000000,
   "creator": "0:2ea5e3968ec8f8cc256a434544b100bcf0e7743f1975743237cf8dc9cdfdad88",
   "maximum": 1,
   "startTime": 1638973091
}

3. Then it needs to be sent to collectible root with collection hash (which was returned by sdk) and collectible will be deployed.




## Token mint 

1. Sends transaction with mintCost of the collectible.
